# Reflection for Module 1 Assignment: Personal Resume

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?
My code creates A Personal Resume webpage using the semantic HTML. It includes key sections such as About Me, Skills, Experience, Education, Portfolio, and Contact Information.
-The <header> displays my name, title and a professional SVG icon.
-The <main> organizes the core content into semantuc <section> elements for better access.
-<footer> contains contact details and links.
-Images and alt texts are used or visual appeal and accessibility.
-ARIA labels and roles help screen readers navigate the content.
Together, these components make a clean, accessible and user friendly resume webpage.


## 2. What was my coding process?
I began coding by planning the overall structure of my resume and then breaking it out into several structures like my personal details, experience, education and my philosophy.
- Firstly,I created the basic HTML structure using <header>, <main> and <footer>
- Then I added the content according to the instructions.
-Then I included images, my personal avatar and some images of the proojects which were to be honest not made by me.
Finally, I validated the code using W3C Validator and believe me I got couple of red and yellow sign.Then cleaned them all and made a perfecct, error free resume.
Also,Git for version controlled helped me in tracking the progress.


## 3. What challenges did I have?
Some of the challenges that I faced were:
-HTML Validation errors: When i checked it W3C i got various errors, thus then fixing it took a lot of time.
-Indentation problems: I was literally so stuck in correcting the indentation because when I was adding something the indentation used to get so disturbed that it didnt look appealing.
-Also,Adding feacutures like ARIA,Svg required a little research.

## 4. What would I do differently now?
If I were to restart this project:
- I would plan the file structure and content earlier to avoid rework.
- I would focus more on accessibility features from the very beginning rather than adding them at the end.
- I would take care the indentation is not disturbed even a bit.
- I would also do a little research on how to make it more appealing.
